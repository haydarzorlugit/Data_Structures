# Data Structures with C

This project is designed for those who want to learn how basic data structures work using the **C language**.  
Each structure is supported by both **sample code** and **visuals**.  

## Contents
- Array  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Linked List  
- Tree  

## Objective
To understand the logic behind data structures, reinforce it with code examples, and establish a solid foundation for algorithmic work.  

## Usage
After cloning the project, you can compile and run any file you want. For example:

```bash
gcc stack.c -o stack
./stack
```
